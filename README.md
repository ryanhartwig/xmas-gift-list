<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<br><br/>

This webapp was created in a pinch to allow my family to post various gift ideas for themselves, while marking off purchases they intend to make on other people's lists.

This was created as an interface for my family only, and all write priviledges have been removed.

User's can:

- Add or delete gift ideas of their own
- Mark someone else's gift purchased, which will NOT show on that person's list
- Mark an item as purchased anonymously, which will hide the buyer's name for everybody
- In every case regardless, the item owner will never see who is purchasing any of their items
